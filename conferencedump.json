The disruptions in our economy, for both good and ill, offer our leaders opportunities to reframe the essential social contract we have with each other. It also asks government to rethink its relationship with its citizens. From safety nets to operation systems, from personal identity to income inequality, we need to rewire that social contract. New America has been leading these conversations for more than a decade. In this election year, we are poised to play a pivotal role in how the leading candidates write the new social contract. As the primary season settles and the general election turns its focus on our most pressing challenges, we will bring together the most original thinking on the most important public issues, to create conversations you won't hear anywhere else.</p><p>New America is dedicated to the renewal of American politics, prosperity, and purpose in the Digital Age. We carry out our mission as a nonprofit civic enterprise: an intellectual venture capital fund, think tank, technology laboratory, public forum, and media platform. Our hallmarks are big ideas, impartial analysis, pragmatic policy solutions, technological innovation, next generation politics, and creative engagement with broad audiences.</p><p><strong>View a PDF of the conference program by\u00a0<a href=\"http://annualconference.newamerica.org/assets/pdf/conference-program.pdf\">clicking here</a>.</strong></p>", "subheading": "The Next Social Contract", "story_excerpt": null, "story_image": 1, "about_image": 2, "host_organization": "New America", "rsvp_link": "", "date": "2016-12-01", "end_date": "2016-12-03", "location_name": "Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center", "street": "1300 Pennsylvania Ave NW", "city": "Washington", "state": "D.C.", "zipcode": "20004", "venue": "[{\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p><strong>The conference is being held in the Pavilion Room of the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center.
