Surveys in the dashboard explore the general public’s opinion on issues pertaining to higher education such as funding, diversity, and value. Some focus on opinion of first-year college students, college and university presidents, and faculty. The dashboard is a helpful source for researchers, journalists, and the general public who are interested in understanding public opinion on higher education issues. It is, however, by no means an exhaustive source of public opinion surveys about higher education. If you know of a survey that could be added to the site, please email the survey to nguyens@newamerica.org.</p><p></p></div>\n      </div>\n    \n\n    \n      <div class=\"block-dataviz\">\n        \n<div class=\"dataviz dataviz-project na-dataviz full-width\" data-id=\"dashboard\">\n\t<div class=\"dataviz__title-container \" style=\"max-width: Nonepx\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<a id=\"chart-dashboard\" class=\"in-depth__panel__anchor\"></a>\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"dataviz__chart-container\" style=\"max-width: Nonepx\">\n\t\t<div class=\"dataviz__loading-gif\"></div>\n\t\t<div class=\"dataviz__chart-area\" id=\"dashboard\"></div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n      </div>\n    \n\n    \n      <div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n        <div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Methodology</h3><p>Surveys in the dashboard were collected by searching “higher education public opinion survey” in Google News. To be added, the survey needed to address the general public or other groups&#x27; opinion on at least one issue in higher education, be transparent about the methodology, and add the margins of error included where possible. Most of the surveys in the dashboard are nationally representative, but some surveys that look into a specific population such as students, faculty, or administrators, may only capture the responses of those surveyed. To capture relatively recent data, we chose 2010 as the first year in which to include surveys; those before 2010 were excluded.</p></div>\n      </div>\n    \n\n",
