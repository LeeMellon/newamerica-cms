Only one-third of Americans believe higher education is fine the way it is. Cost is the primary concern for the large majority who do not agree that higher education is fine the way it is.\n--The vast majority of Americans (90 percent) believe that publicly available data on low graduation rates, high dropout rates, low earnings, and high student loan default rates are important indicators of quality. A majority of respondents also believe that public financial support for colleges and universities should be tied to some of these outcomes. ",

Twoyear institutions are leading the way, with 57% of faculty at 2-year institutions reporting that their school is achieving an ideal digital learning environment. This reflects a 19% jump in sentiment from May and a 23% increase from before COVID-19.

The biggest drop reported between May and August is in the asynchronous category. However, faculty teaching at introductory course levels are more likely to report delivering instruction through asynchronous methods than their peers teaching upper-level courses.\n--While we are seeing some movement in this direction with 17% of faculty reporting more centralization of decision making, 60% said the decision-making process remains the same. We are not yet witnessing—at least from the faculty perspective—a massive movement to centralized decision making about materials selection and adoption.\n--Top faculty priorities in planning fo the fall term includes: increasing student engagement in class, providing timely feedback for students, ensuring accessibility for all students, and redesigning my course around online delivery.",

      "findings": "--The vast majority of faculty (91%) reported that they transitioned their courses to remote delivery\nin the spring; the remainder were either already teaching fully online and kept teaching (7%) or\nreported that their class had been cancelled or suspended (2%). Overall, fewer than half of these\nfaculty who transitioned a course reported that they had taught online before and thus were\nteaching in a remote delivery format for the first time. Faculty at 2-year institutions were more\nlikely to report prior experience teaching online.\n--Top challenges for faculty include: keep students engaged, providing additional support/remediation to students, administering secure exams, and transitioning instructional content to a remote environment.\n--The largest portion of faculty reported using some combination of synchronous and asynchronous\ndelivery during the spring term. This percentage did not differ by institutional type but by course\nlevel: faculty teaching introductory courses used asynchronous instruction at higher rates (38% vs.\n26%) than their upper-level teaching peers. While the LMS was the tool most ubiquitously used by faculty, nearly half of respondents reported first-time use of video conferencing. The scale at which video conferencing was adopted outpaces the rest of the categories. Faculty were most likely to report using their LMS, assessment and collaboration tools, and e-textbooks for the first time. \n--45% said their perception of online learning has become more favorable since the start of COVID-19, whereas only 17% said it had become more negative.\n--Adjunct faculty are less likely to have past experience teaching online, meaning they are likely to need more support. However, they have less support—reporting, for example, lower availability of instructional design staff at their institutions compared to their peers (49% vs. 56%). Perhaps as a result, during the spring transition they were more likely to use synchronous teaching and employed fewer instructional practices.",
