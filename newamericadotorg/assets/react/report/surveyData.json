Only one-third of Americans believe higher education is fine the way it is. Cost is the primary concern for the large majority who do not agree that higher education is fine the way it is.\n--The vast majority of Americans (90 percent) believe that publicly available data on low graduation rates, high dropout rates, low earnings, and high student loan default rates are important indicators of quality. A majority of respondents also believe that public financial support for colleges and universities should be tied to some of these outcomes. ",

Twoyear institutions are leading the way, with 57% of faculty at 2-year institutions reporting that their school is achieving an ideal digital learning environment. This reflects a 19% jump in sentiment from May and a 23% increase from before COVID-19.

The biggest drop reported between May and August is in the asynchronous category. However, faculty teaching at introductory course levels are more likely to report delivering instruction through asynchronous methods than their peers teaching upper-level courses.\n--While we are seeing some movement in this direction with 17% of faculty reporting more centralization of decision making, 60% said the decision-making process remains the same.

This percentage did not differ by institutional type but by course\nlevel: faculty teaching introductory courses used asynchronous instruction at higher rates (38% vs.\n26%) than their upper-level teaching peers. While the LMS was the tool most ubiquitously used by faculty, nearly half of respondents reported first-time use of video conferencing. The scale at which video conferencing was adopted outpaces the rest of the categories. Faculty were most likely to report using their LMS, assessment and collaboration tools, and e-textbooks for the first time. \n--45% said their perception of online learning has become more favorable since the start of COVID-19, whereas only 17% said it had become more negative.\n--Adjunct faculty are less likely to have past experience teaching online, meaning they are likely to need more support. However, they have less support—reporting, for example, lower availability of instructional design staff at their institutions compared to their peers (49% vs. 56%). Perhaps as a result, during the spring transition they were more likely to use synchronous teaching and employed fewer instructional practices.",

Four in ten students had to make purchases to engage in remote learning successfully, and they had to purchase a wide range of items; approximately 6 percent of students said they've been infected with COVID-19. And 16 percent said they have lost their job due to COVID-19.\n--Student enrollment, retention, completion, and transfer plans remain steadier than anticipated, but dangers may lie ahead: most currently-enrolled students plan to continue their college trajectory. Despite heightened uncertainty and an abrupt shift to online learning, nine-in-ten college students plan to re-enroll in their current school next year (90 percent); a majority of colleges and universities say they will be hybrid this fall. But a large proportion of students will choose fully online even if their institution is hybrid, particularly for some of our oversamples; perhaps due to the disproportionate impact the pandemic has had on the Black community, these students would be most likely to re-enroll if the institution provided on-campus coronavirus testing and contact tracing, in addition to offering personal protective equipment to students (77 percent more likely, 51 percent much more), compared to all students (69 percent more likely, 38 percent much more); around one-in-three college students report definitely or probably needing more time to complete college due to the pandemic (32 percent).\n--Students’ have significant worries about the economic fallout from COVID-19 and the resulting value of a higher education credential: in the midst of a pandemic, college students are most intensely concerned about their family and friends catching coronavirus or catching it themselves (56 percent, 52 percent significant concern, respectively); the overall most effective measure an institution that accepts coronavirus relief money can take in order to get students to re-enroll is to offer discounted tuition if classes are fully online (74 percent more likely to enroll or re-enroll, 51 percent much more likely to enroll or re-enroll); students still believe that a vocational training certificate, an Associate’s degree, and a Bachelor’s degree are all worth the investment and usually pay off (82 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent agree, respectively).",

The challenge was to prepare all faculty members who had not previously taught online classes by giving them a primer on the basic elements of good online instruc on and familiarizing them with available tools, then charging them with conver ng their courses to remote instruc on in a ma er of days. In general, the number of faculty members that needed such prepara on and training averaged 50% of the ins tu on’s en re faculty.\n--Campus student readiness for remote learning was also a widespread challenge. As established in CHLOE 4, only 30% of ins tu ons require orienta on of students planning to take online classes, and many others do not have even an op onal formal introduc on to online study. In late February or early March 2020, however, all campus-based ins tu ons suddenly faced the need to prepare all their face-to-face students for online or remote learning. For most ins tu ons, approximately half their students had never taken a single online course—an amount that would have overwhelmed the capabili es of a student orienta on program, even where one existed.\n--Looking back from the vantage point of May 2020, when their ins tu ons were wrapping up their  rst series of remote courses, most chief online o cers judge their ins tu on’s pivot to remote educa on as “very successful” or “largely successful.” More speci cally, 21% of responding ins tu ons judged the pivot to be “very successful,” and 57% considered it “largely successful.” Combining the posi ve responses, more than three quarters (78%) of chief online o cers believe the pivot was a success at their ins tu on.\n--Twenty- ve percent of COOs judged the campus-based faculty’s a tude toward online learning as very posi ve a er going through the remote pivot, and 42% thought faculty were somewhat posi ve. Thirty percent did not think faculty a tudes were a ected by the remote experience, and only about 11% had developed more of a nega ve view.\n--The CHLOE 5 data indicate that 11% of responding online o cers an cipate strongly increased interest in online learning at their ins tu ons among face-to-face students who were a ected by remote teaching during the pandemic, and another 53% expect modestly increased interest from this group.",

This pattern holds across party lines, with 72% of Democrats and 63% of Republicans agreeing about the need for greater oversight.\n--Republicans want more, not fewer, strings attached to how institutions spend coronavirus funds. Similarly, voters across the political spectrum demonstrated a strong preference for “giving higher education billions of dollars in coronavirus relief funds with more guardrails and accountability in place, to make sure the money is not being used to defraud students” over “giving higher education institutions coronavirus relief funds with fewer strings attached because they know how to best help their students” (76% to 24%). Remarkably, Republicans were equally committed to this sentiment, with 78% of GOP-identifying likely voters urging stronger guardrails compared to 76% of Democrats (a difference within the margin of error).\n--Voters care a lot about where their taxpayer dollars are going. In a clear show of preference, likely voters support the federal government providing basic guardrails to ensure students aren’t using taxpayer dollars to attend predatory institutions, instead of abiding by the view that the federal government should not try to influence where students spend taxpayer dollars (71% to 29%, respectively).",

Similarly, 75% of graduate and professional students from China adapted well or very well to remote instruction compared to 64% from India and 60% from Mexico.\n--In general, international students faced similar obstacles as domestic students in their transition to remote instruction (but at a slightly lower rate): the lack of motivation for remote learning (54% of international undergraduate students and 56% of graduate students), the lack of interaction with other students (44% and 55%, respectively) inability to learn effectively in an online format (42% and 40%). However, for international undergraduate students who relocated to a different country during the pandemic the top three of most important obstacles also included inability to attend classes at their scheduled online meeting time -- 38% of students reported that obstacle.\n--More than two-thirds of undergraduate students reported managing immigration issues was stressful for them (Figure 3). The most important concerns were managing their current visa status and travel restrictions between the U.S. and their home country. The impact on future employment-based visas concludes the top three of most stressful immigration-related issues for international students.\n--Graduate and professional students were more concerned about travel restrictions (61%), followed by managing their visa status and the impact upon their future employment-based visas.\n--One-fourth of international undergraduate, graduate, and professional students were concerned with xenophobia, harassment or discrimination. More worrisome, 17% of international undergraduate students and 12% of graduate and professional students personally experienced instances of intimidating, hostile, or offensive behavior based on their national origin.

      "findings": "--Week 1 (April 1): The financial fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic is already real for nearly half of the American workforce. Many have already seen their hours or income reduced. Fifty-seven percent of Americans are worried about losing their jobs; one-third of American workers believe that if they do lose their jobs, they will need additional education to find comparable ones. Americans’ top choices for future investments in their own education or training are for online or on-the-job programs. If they have $5,000 to invest in their education and training, 26% say they would prefer to spend it on online college or university, 18% say apprenticeship or internship with local employer, 17% online community college.\n--Week 2 (April 8): 61% already have lost income. One in three Americans (34%) believe they would need more education or training to replace a lost job with one that pays a similar wage or salary. Of those who believe they need more education or training: 64% would look to change careers, 66% are confident they know where to find the education or training they need, 54% say online programs are their most popular choice for education providers.\n--Week 3 (April 15): Most Americans (55%) have either lost jobs or had their hours or income reduced, but millennials have felt that impact more than other generations.The majority of adults (70%) believe that for them personally, the effects of the crisis will not last longer than six months. One-third of Americans believe they would need more education to find a comparable job if they were to lose theirs. That belief is most pronounced among Generation X (38%) and millennials (37%).\n--Week 4(April 22): Most Americans (62%) are worried they will lose their jobs, but people of color are more worried. Thirty-four percent of Americans feel they would need more education to find a comparable job if they lost theirs, with Latino (38%) and Asian Americans (36%) most likely to believe they would need more. Thirty-six percent of Americans would change career fields if they lost their jobs in the crisis. Black Americans (32%) are less likely to want to change career fields. Americans would prefer to invest in their online education and training options (53%) over in person (26%) and employer-provided choices (21%).\n--Week 5 (April 29): 11% of American adults have canceled their education plans because of COVID-19. The majority of adults considering enrolling in an education or training program in the next six months prefer nondegree programs (59%). For Americans looking to enroll in the next six months, their interests are divided evenly among reskilling (34%), upskilling (34%), and pursuing personal interests (33%). Americans’ intent to enroll in postsecondary education and training in the next five years (49%) has not increased from 2019 (53%). But their intentions about where to enroll have shifted.\n--Week 6 (May 6): 60% of American workers say they prefer nondegree and skill-based education and training programs, 46% prefer the training to be delivered online. 20% would prefer to invest in an online college or university program if they had $5,000 available to invest in their future. 16% would want to get a certificate, certification, or license if they were to enroll in additional education or training sometime within the next six months.\n--Week 7 (May 13): About one-third have started a new job in the past month, and those who have completed graduate or professional degrees are much more likely to start a new job.\n--Week 8 (May 20): About one-third of Americans ages 18 to 64 have cancelled or changed their education plans. Nearly two thirds of American younger adults (ages 18-24) have cancelled or changed their education plans. For those who said they have adjusted their education plans, 37% have delayed planned enrollment in courses, training, or program; 26% have reduced the number of courses or amount of training; 20% have changed the school or provider of courses or training.\n--Week 9 (June 10): Black Americans (23%) and Latinos (24%) are more likely than white Americans (15%) and Asian Americans (13%) to have been laid off. Black Americans and Latinos are also more likely to have started new full- or part-time jobs in the past month. Black Americans and Latinos are more likely than white Americans to have changed or canceled their education plans. Compared to other racial and ethnic groups, black Americans rank advice about education and training from colleges and universities as less valuable than advice from other sources such as families or the Internet.\n--Week 10 (June 24): One out of three workers (35%) say they would change their field of work if they lost their job. For workers interested in changing job fields, the fields they are most likely to transition into are business fields (18%), information technology (14%), or finance (9%). While many workers who are looking to make a career transition need to reskill, less than half (44%) of Americans say they have access to the education and training they want. Americans strongly prefer nondegree programs and skills training over degree programs (62% vs. 38%).\n--Week 11 (July 15): Adults without degrees or credentials are divided when it comes to the value of additional education: Sixty-two percent agree that it would advance their career, 52% agree that it would be worth the cost, 50% agree that it would help get them a job in times of economic uncertainty. Americans identify three primary challenges to enrolling: More than half (55%) say work and family commitments, course schedules, and transportation are major concerns, nearly half (49%) fear they won’t be successful students or have been out of school too long, nearly half (48%) say cost is an extremely or very challenging barrier to enrolling. Many adults without degrees or credentials (42%) say they were very or extremely interested in education or training after high school, but nearly two-thirds of them (64%) say they didn’t have a good understanding of how to pay for it.\n--Week 12 (July 29): Three in 10 Americans say that even if COVID-19 was not a threat, they’d prefer an online-only learning option; nearly half of women would choose an exclusively online option if they enrolled in the next six months; 60% of Black are confident in the quality of online courses, compared to 46% of LatinX, 43% of white, and 35% of Asian; 35% of Americans say online-only have the best value for their money, 32% say hybrid programs, and 33% say in-person programs.\n--Week 13 (August 12): 50% of Americans think that until the coronavirus is under control, attending college classes in person should be forbidden; the other half think that it should be personal decision. 38% of American workers who lost a job or income during the pandemic say they are more likely to enroll because of COVID-19. 1 in 3 disrupted low-income workers say they have access to the education and training they want. The majority of students (56%) believe they will get less value from the education provided this fall compared to last year.\n--Week 14 (August 26): 2 in 5 Americans (38%) say the most important factors in choosing an education program are whether it is related to their work and suited to their personal needs. 1 in 3 Americans (35%) cite safety as the most important factor in deciding among in-person, hybrid, or online education. Americans without a college degree are more likely to identify comfort and support as the most important factor in deciding among in-person, hybrid and online options. The majority of Americans (62%) have expressed a consistent preference for nondegree and skills training options, citing as their top reasons: better value, better fit for my personal needs, more benefit to my job and career advancement.\n--Week 15 (September 16): Adults considering enrolling in education are less likely than a year ago to believe it will be worth the cost and get them a good job. 2 in 3 (68%) adults considering enrolling in education prefer nondegree pathways, up from 1 in 2 (50%) a year ago. The portion of Americans without degrees who cite the ability to pay bills and take care of immediate needs as the primary benefit of education has doubled since a year ago. For adults without degrees, worry about finding a satisfying career ranks nearly as high as worries about needs such as having enough to eat or paying rent. Fewer than 1 in 3 adults without degrees say they understand available career pathways, valuable skills, and details about potential education programs “very well.”\n--Week 16 (October 15): Students rank emotional well-being as their biggest challenge this fall — well ahead of cost, academic rigor, or internet access; 13% of college students expect COVID-19 will delay their graduation; nearly one-third of college students say online instruction has made their ability to learn “much worse.”\n--Week 17 (October 27): Only 1 in 3 college students say their school is “excellent” or “very good” at connecting education to meaningful careers; 1 in 5 college students say COVID-19 has made their opportunities for career exploration “much worse”; fewer than 1 in 5 current college students strongly agree their education will be worth the cost; when students have the support to connect their education to a career, they are more likely to say their education will be worth the cost.\n--Week 18 (November 12): 1 in 4 Americans without a college degree say more education and training would make no difference in their ability to get a good job or advance in their career; half of Americans don’t believe a good job is within their reach, or that they can advance in their careers; many feel powerless over their ability to get a good job or advance their career due to perceptions that the system for hiring and advancing at work isn’t fair, employer supports are insufficient, or they lack the right skills; interest in work-based and online training programs has increased substantially throughout the pandemic.",

Most institutions distribute online revenue to meet overall institutional needs.\n--Most institutions anticipate supplementary, not transformative, changes in online learning in the coming years. Interest in new tools and learning strategies is diffuse and noncommittal. Faculty remains central to online course development. Instructional design support is widely available, but most often is optional at the faculty member’s discretion. In enterprise-level programs and many private nonprofits, however, design support is required.\n--Less than quarter of institutions use online program management (OPM) providers to support online program promotion and development, and for many, such partnerships are supplemental. Larger programs and private nonprofits are likely to own their online courses, while shared or faculty ownership is more common in two- and four-year public institutions. In 40% of community colleges, faculty do not receive compensation for course development, while compensation is nearly universal among larger programs and private nonprofits.\n--The majority of online programs have adopted quality standards for course design, program design, online faculty development, and student outcomes. Quality assurance for support services lags behind. The most commonly used input metrics are program reputation, faculty training, and faculty credentials. The most commonly used outcomes metrics are student retention/graduation rates, student academic achievement, and post-graduation student employment.\n\n",
